  <body> <p>Here's is where I will begin with my notes. In the first part of this lesson I learned that a <b>webpage</b> is just an HTML document that a webrowser interperts and display
  The second lesson would be <em>"the way coding works"</em>. Simply put, coding is when a programmer wirtes in a langauge that a computer can understand.</p> I am for going grammer and sentence structure in an attempt to practice the cool tags I have learned.<br>
Point three would be computers are stupid, you must write exactly what you mean so that they may interpret correctly. <a href="google.com">Click here!</a> Lesson four would be the one I have found to be the most useful thus far, and that would be programmers can not remember <strong>everything!</strong>
THe final lesson would be understanding basic html terms, <b>Tag</b>: used to create changes in the text and also alter stucture, elements a tag and all contents within that tag, and attribute "tag modifiers"
